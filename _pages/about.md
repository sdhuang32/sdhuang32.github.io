I'm a DevOps enthusiast with a focus on highly available, scalable, and reliable infrastructure, containerization, AWS, and automation techniques.

"Do the right things the right way" is my self discipline and principle of doing anything; I'm dedicated to those simple, elegant, efficient solutions, and enjoy the times solving root causes of tough problems.

Outside of work, I'm a 10+ years slow-pitch softball lover and like to explore different beautiful national parks and beaches.

## Research
My master's thesis is a digital watermark scheme, regarding using cryptographic tools to insert unforgeable and subject-related watermark into a 2-D grayscale image to resolve the copyright ownership dispute under adversarial watermark removal attacks.

My advisor is [Prof. Pei-Yih Ting (丁培毅)](http://squall.cs.ntou.edu.tw/).
